                       New Delhi : The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday appointed new state presidents in four states, including poll-bound Telangana in what is seen as the first wave of organisational changes ahead of key state elections later this year and the national elections in 2024, with more changes in the organisation, and even a reshuffle of the Union Cabinet, expected in coming days.
                     Among the changes announced on Tuesday, Union minister G Kishen Reddy has been appointed the president of the state unit in Telangana, while Etela Rajender has been given charge of the election management committee. In Punjab, Ashwani Sharma has been replaced by Sunil Jhakhar, a former Congressman and state unit chief, who joined the BJP in March 2022, following a public showdown over being overlooked for the position of Punjab CM. Former minister in the UPA government, D Purandeshwari, was appointed as the president of the Andhra Pradesh unit, where the BJP has been aggressively pushing for expanding its footprint. She replaces Somu Veeraju.

                       Radicals try to burn down San Francisco consulate

                       Washington/New Delhi : The attack on Indiaâ€™s consulate in San Francisco and threats to senior diplomats in Australia, Canada and the US through posters issued by pro-Khalistan elements are being seen as another instance of coordinated action, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
                       Violent Khalistani activists sought to burn down the Indian consulate in San Francisco in the early hours of July 2 in what they claimed was an attempt to avenge the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a designated terrorist, in Canada last month.
                       The latest attack, coming a little more than three months after another violent incident at the same mission, was brought to the attention of the highest rung of American national security and diplomatic apparatus in Washington DC, which instructed its agencies to immediately investigate the incident, step up security, and offer all assistance to Indian officials. The US state department described the attack as a criminal offence.
